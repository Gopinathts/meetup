# Earth Lab Data Meetup

Welcome to the Earth Lab data meetup GitHub page!
This is where we can discuss events, and you can opt in for notifications about upcoming meetups.
Our web page has migrated to https://earthlab.github.io/meetup

## How to participate

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'.

 This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).

 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the sidebar on the right; this is where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi.
