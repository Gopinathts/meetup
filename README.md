# Earth Lab Incubator

Welcome to the Earth Lab Incubator GitHub page!
This is where we can discuss events, and you can opt in for notifications about upcoming meetups.
Our intent is to foster an environment for new ideas, collaborations, feedback and data/analytics dives. 
Our web page has migrated to https://earthlab.github.io/meetup

The upcoming schedule will be updated here:

## How to participate

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'.

 This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).

 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the sidebar on the right; this is where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi.
